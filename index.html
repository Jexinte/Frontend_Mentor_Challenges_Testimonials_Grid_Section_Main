                <p class="main--title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                
                <p class="main--comments">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br> 
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                  for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                  The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                  the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <p class="main--title">Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</p>
                <p class="main--comments">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
                  professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
                  student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br>  curriculum and staff 
                  did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
                  project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
                  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
                  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
                  100% recommend! ”</p>
